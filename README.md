# AI Knowledge Companion - Evidence-Based Analysis Platform

## Project Overview

**AI Knowledge Companion** is a full-stack web application that provides **evidence-based AI analysis** with proper document citation. Unlike generic AI responses, this platform ensures every insight, claim, and recommendation is grounded in your specific documents with clear source citations.

### Core Mission

- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: All AI responses are rooted in your uploaded documents with proper citations
- **Transparency & Reliability**: Every claim includes specific references to source materials
- **Consistent Quality**: Structured approach to document analysis ensures reliable results
- **Privacy-First**: Client-side processing with no external data storage

### Key Achievements

- **Evidence-based AI integration** with proper citation tracking
- **Full-stack development** with modern React patterns and TypeScript
- **Local-first architecture** ensuring privacy and performance
- **Serverless deployment** with Netlify Functions
- **Real-world problem solving** for document processing and knowledge management

## Technical Stack & Skills Demonstrated

### Frontend Development

- **React 18** with modern hooks and functional components
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design
- **Custom hooks** for state management and business logic

### Backend & AI Integration

- **Netlify Functions** for serverless backend services
- **OpenRouter API** integration with multiple AI models
- **Local storage** using IndexedDB for client-side data persistence
- **File processing** with PDF.js, mammoth.js, and OCR capabilities

### Architecture & DevOps

- **Serverless architecture** with Netlify deployment
- **Environment management** with secure API key handling
- **CORS handling** and cross-origin request management
- **Performance optimization** with local processing and caching

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality

- **Document Collections**: Create and manage document collections with local storage
- **Multi-format Support**: Process PDFs, DOCX, TXT files, and images with OCR
- **URL Processing**: Extract and index content from web articles and pages
- **Cited AI Chat**: Intelligent Q&A with specific citations from uploaded documents
- **Evidence-Based Reports**: Exportable reports with key insights backed by document citations

### Evidence-Based Analysis Features

- **Source Citation**: Every AI response includes specific references to source documents
- **Document Grounding**: Analysis is limited to content from uploaded materials
- **Transparency**: Clear indication of which documents support each claim
- **Consistency**: Structured approach ensures reliable, reproducible results

### Technical Features

- **Local Indexing**: Smart document chunking and vector embeddings
- **Privacy-First Design**: All processing happens locally, only AI calls go external
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, accessible interface that works on all devices
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback systems

## Architecture Decisions

### Why This Tech Stack?

- **Next.js 14**: Chosen for its performance optimizations and modern React patterns
- **TypeScript**: Ensures code quality and maintainability in a complex application
- **Netlify Functions**: Provides serverless backend without managing infrastructure
- **Local Storage**: Prioritizes user privacy and reduces server costs
- **OpenRouter**: Offers access to multiple AI models with intelligent routing

### Evidence-Based Approach

- **Citation Tracking**: Built-in system to track and display source references
- **Document Grounding**: AI responses are constrained to uploaded content
- **Transparency**: Users can verify claims by checking cited sources
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured prompts ensure consistent citation format

### Problem-Solving Approach

- **CORS Issues**: Solved by implementing serverless functions for URL extraction
- **File Processing**: Built comprehensive pipeline for multiple document formats
- **AI Integration**: Created abstraction layer for multiple AI providers
- **Performance**: Optimized with local processing and intelligent caching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (required by package.json engines)
- OpenRouter API key (free tier available at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai))

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/atapia27/Companion.git
cd Companion

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Netlify Functions dependencies
cd netlify/functions && npm install && cd ../..

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY to .env.local

# Start development server with Netlify Functions
npm run dev:full
```

### Development Commands

- `npm run dev:full` - Start both Next.js and Netlify Functions (recommended)


### Environment Setup
