- **Local-first architecture** ensuring privacy and performance
- **Serverless deployment** with Netlify Functions
- **Real-world problem solving** for document processing and knowledge management

## Technical Stack & Skills Demonstrated

### Frontend Development

- **React 18** with modern hooks and functional components
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design
- **Custom hooks** for state management and business logic

### Backend & AI Integration

- **Netlify Functions** for serverless backend services
- **OpenRouter API** integration with multiple AI models
- **Local storage** using IndexedDB for client-side data persistence
- **File processing** with PDF.js, mammoth.js, and OCR capabilities

### Architecture & DevOps

- **Serverless architecture** with Netlify deployment
- **Environment management** with secure API key handling
- **CORS handling** and cross-origin request management
- **Performance optimization** with local processing and caching

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality

- **Document Collections**: Create and manage document collections with local storage
- **Multi-format Support**: Process PDFs, DOCX, TXT files, and images with OCR
- **URL Processing**: Extract and index content from web articles and pages
